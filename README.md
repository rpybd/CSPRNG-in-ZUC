#Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator in AES-BOX and ZUC

This RNG is cryptographically secure(get 96 higher in sts test of 100 sequences). It uses the method of ZUC Algorithm while replaces the box with AES's and increases its lineral characteristic by random-pool.

USE NIST sts 2.1.2 to evaluate generated random numbers.
